The [ADAL GitHub repo](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-dotnet) is used for future development of MSAL and ADAL.
We have done this to enable easier code sharing between the two libraries. You can see build status in that repo.

This is the correct repo to file issues and to search for documentation related to MSAL.
